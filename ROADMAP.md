## Section 1: Immediate Goals for Daily Use

This section has been updated to reflect the current state of the codebase. It is now a checklist of the remaining work required to make DevHub a robust and indispensable tool for the "Jira ticket to AI-produced PR" workflow.

### Epic: Make DevHub Production-Ready for Daily AI-Assisted Workflows

#### âœ… Core Functionality and Quality

- [ ] Ticket 1: Finalize World-Class Test Coverage
  - [ ] Increase overall test coverage from 51% to >95%.
  - [ ] Harden sdk.py by increasing test coverage from 0% to >90%.
  - [ ] Harden mcp_server.py by increasing test coverage from 55% to >90%.
  - [ ] Harden main.py by increasing test coverage from 62% to >85%.

#### ðŸ¤– AI Agent and IDE Integration

- [ ] Ticket 2: Harden the Python SDK for Production Use
  - [ ] Add comprehensive tests and executable examples to the SDK.
  - [ ] Verify and test the SDK's error handling for API failures.
- [ ] Ticket 3: Finalize Machine-Readable CLI Output
  - [ ] Add integration tests to validate the JSON output for bundle and context commands.
  - [ ] Document the JSON output schema for agent consumption.
- [ ] Ticket 4: Polish IDE Integration Documents
  - [ ] Refine and verify the code examples in IDE_INTEGRATIONS.md.
  - [ ] Ensure the guides for VS Code and Cursor are clear and easy to follow.

#### ðŸ“š Documentation and User Experience

- [ ] Ticket 5: Implement a Seamless User Onboarding Experience
  - [ ] Create a devhub setup command for an interactive user onboarding experience.
  - [ ] Enhance the CLI output with rich formatting for better readability.

## Section 2: The Bigger Vision

This section outlines the long-term, ambitious goals for DevHub. These are the "nice-to-have" features that will evolve the tool from a developer's assistant into a semi-autonomous development platform.

### ðŸ§  Intelligent and Automated Workflows

- [ ] Smart Context Detection: Automatically discover related PRs, linked Jira issues, and dependent code changes.
- [ ] Workflow Integration: Integrate DevHub with Git hooks and CI/CD pipelines to automate context gathering.
- [ ] Enhanced Analysis Capabilities: Implement code impact analysis and review quality metrics.

### ðŸ¤– Autonomous AI-Driven Development

- [ ] AI Agent Framework: Build an SDK and runtime for creating custom, autonomous AI agents.
- [ ] Autonomous Workflows: Create a fully automated "ticket-to-implementation" pipeline.
- [ ] Learning and Adaptation: Develop a system that learns from your team's coding patterns to provide tailored suggestions.
- [ ] Quality Assurance and Safety: Implement AI decision auditing and safety guardrails for all automated actions.
